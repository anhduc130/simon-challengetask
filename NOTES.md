The difficulty I had for this task was to disable and enable the NoteBoxes properly so that:
+ The player could not click on the boxes when the app is playing a sequence of notes.
+ The player could not click on the boxes if he/she already clicked on the boxes as many as the number of notes generated by the app.
+ If the player clicked on the wrong box, the game must restart and all the NoteBoxes should be disabled so that the app can start playing a new sequence of notes.

Most of the sources I used for this task are from www.w3schools.com. It is an interesting task; it took time to cover all the cases that might happen.

Thank you! Cheers :)
